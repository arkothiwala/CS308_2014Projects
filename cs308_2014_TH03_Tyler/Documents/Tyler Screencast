Tyler Screencast
================

Hi,

Myself Anil and in this screencast I am going to show you how to setup Tyler.

Tyler is a proof of concept implementation of what we imagine stores to be in the future.
Stores using Tyler are manned by bots which act like sales persons. We use a set of overhead cameras to track movement of people
and automatically move bots around based on this. When customer engages the bot, he talks to a person
who is sitting remotely at a call center. This gives many benefits like reduction in manpower needed, flexibility of work
location, etc.

Tyler consists of broadly three parts, the bot, the host and the remote.

Let us start with the bot code, the bot code is in FB5_ARM folder. You can simply copy the bin file to Firebird.
The project can be opened in Kiel. <Show the file in finder>

Now let us start the host. The host consists of two parts, the tracker algorithm used to track the people in the store and the bot.

Instructions:
1. First we have to install 'wampserver' (refer to video tutorial for this step)
2. Next, this current folder 'serial_port' needs to be copied to the location 'C:\wamp\www\'
3. Then, we have to configure and start an ad-hoc Wifi network ("http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-create-wireless-ad-hoc-internet-connection-in-windows-8/")
4. Then we need to install an android application in our mobile phone (which is acting as the live feed camera)
5. The android application is IP Webcam ("https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam")
6. Then, we need to connect our mobile phone to this ad hoc network.
7. After this we need to open IP Webcam and 'Begin Server' (We may need to change 'line 19' in script 'callpy.php' as per the given IP address shown in IP Webcam app)
8. Now we can attach the mobile on top of the FireBird to act as live feed camera
9. Next we need to connect Xbee module to our PC, and start our Firebird V
10. We need to ensure the Xbee port 'COM4' is open for communication to FireBird V (We can test using X-CTU)
11. Now we run our web application (refer to video tutorial for this step)

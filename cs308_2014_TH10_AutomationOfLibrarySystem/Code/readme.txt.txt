Description:
We have built bot for automation of library system. We have tried to replace typical librarian with a
bot. We found that there is lot of human work involved while placing and retrieving books in library
and complexity for searching and retrieving increases when books in library increases which is
general case in almost all libraries. So in order to reduce human effort we have worked on this
project. In this document an autonomous solution for the robotics librarian is proposed. The aim is
to retrieve a book required by any user, and bringing that book to the user, whether it was founded
in the corresponding bookshelves and placing book back to its corresponding location in shelves
